## Now in A-frame

Built to serve as an intermediate technology demo, this repository builds and serves the code behind [abandoned.ai](https://abandoned.ai) which showcases how abandoned spaces can be effectively preserved using new technology.

This version uses [a-frame.js](https://aframe.io/) as a backend, using the [aframe Gaussian Splatting component library](https://github.com/quadjr/aframe-gaussian-splatting) created by @kfarr.

A-frame uses webGL to render 3D environments in a way that a lot of browsers can universally support, including VR devices like the occulus Quest 3. It also allows us to add better controlls to scenes than the ones provided by the original project.
